# English 10 Honors 2021-22 Vocab - Mr. Giorgi

## About

This repository contains the vocabulary sets for English 10 Honors 2021-22, from Mr. Giorgi at Davis Senior High. I will try to maintain this repository for the entire school year. There is no specific purpose for this repository, it is just for anyone who finds it useful.

## Explanation

Currently this repository contains a single folder, `pdf`, but more folders may be added later. The `pdf` folder will contain every vocabulary set in `pdf` format. I may add other formats later such as `json`. If you have a format suggestion, open an issue.

## Contributing
